# Cheat Engine Research

This folder contains reference `.CT` tables produced and used during the memory analysis for the Yuki「清醒梦」 autosplitter project.

> Important: pointermaps (`.PTR`) and raw memory dumps are intentionally **excluded** from this repository.

## Included
- Clean `.CT` tables with verified addresses and notes.
- Short explanatory notes about scans and how values were identified (if applicable).

## Excluded (do NOT commit)
- Pointermap files (`.PTR`) or any pointermap exports.
- Raw memory dumps or any binary excerpts of the game executable.
- Scripts or tools intended to modify or inject code into the running game.

## Purpose
These `.CT` tables serve as documentation and testing references for contributors working on the autosplitter. They are provided to help reproduce findings and to speed up development of the official autosplitter only.

## How to use
1. Place the `.CT` you want to inspect into Cheat Engine (local machine).  
2. Verify values on your own copy of the game — do not share game binaries.  
3. If you add or update `.CT` tables, include a brief note describing what changed.
